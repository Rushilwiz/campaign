                <h1>experience</h1>
                <p>I've served dilligently over the past three years on student government as class council senator and SGA treasurer. My time at these positions has allowed me to garner the experience needed for a good SGA president. I've seen it all, from Hoco to HackTJ. My contribution has been invaluable, and I am ready to continue serving the school.</p>
